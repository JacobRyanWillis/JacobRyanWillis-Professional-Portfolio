# JacobRyanWillis-Professional-Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this assignment was to get familiar with creating code from scratch in HTML and CSS. I created a professional work portfolio that links the user to all of my projects and media platforms. I had a lot of ideas some more complicated than others that led to me learning a lot of CSS and HTML functionality. I ran into a lot of issues with Media Queries and background images. I spent a lot more time than I care to share on this.
